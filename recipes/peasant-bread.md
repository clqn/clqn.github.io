# peasant bread

one of the staples of my diet; this bread is cheap (about a dozen or so cents a loaf), quick (about 3 hours from start to finish), and incredibly easy (most of the time is spent waiting for it to rise or bake). the original recipe comes from from Alexandra Stafford (original picture-heavy blog post [here](https://alexandracooks.com/2012/11/07/my-mothers-peasant-bread-the-best-easiest-bread-you-will-ever-make/), with a more minimal mirror [here](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/peasant-bread-recipe))

i present it here halved cuz i don't normally need to make more than one loaf.

- 2 cups flour
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 heaping tsp yeast
- 1 cup lukewarm water

mix the dry ingredients together in a bowl, add the water, and mix until the dough is consistent. cover the bowl and let it rise in a warm place for 90 minutes.

preheat the oven to 425°F. Deflate the dough with a fork and transfer it into a greased oven-safe container (i always use a 1.5 quart pyrex bowl). let it rise in a warm place until it roughly doubles in size (about 20-30 minutes)

put the dough in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then turn the heat down to 375°F and bake for another 20. once it looks golden-brown on top, you're done! let it cool before you have some.
