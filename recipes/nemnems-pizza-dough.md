this is a recipe my pal Nemmy Nyms, a partition of [Mx. Ace Fucking Jaycee](https://acey.eerie.garden) shared with me; it's become a staple of my weekends! this is a mirror (with permission!) of hir recipe which is hosted on xeir blog [here](https://acey.eerie.garden/blog/2019/05/05/Nemnems-Pizza-Dough#post-content)

Yields about 2 larger pizzas, or 4-6 personal pan size.

## Ingredients

  - 3 + 3/4 cups of flour (all-purpose is okay, bread flour is fucking amazing)
    [1.75 cups for 1 pizza]
  - 1 to 1+1/4 cups of warm water [0.5 cups for 1 pizza]
  - 2+1/4 teaspoons (or 1 packet, usually) of yeast [1 heaping tsp for 1 pizza]
  - Olive oil (you shouldn't need more than a cup but -shrugs-) 
  - 1-2 teaspoons of sugar (you can really eyeball this. also you can substitute
    with about the same amount of honey) [~1 teaspoon for 1 pizza]
  - 1-2 teaspoons of salt (same. like more than a few shakes of a salt shaker?
    more or less isn't much harm unless you dump an entire salt shaker into it
    [1 teaspoon for 1 pizza]

## Steps

  1) Prep 1 cup of warm water. I feel the temperature with the inside of my
     wrist, it should be warm but not scalding or near painful.

  2) Using the bowl of a food processor (I keep the blade in to start with), a
     stand mixer, or just a normal-ass mixing bowl, add 1 cup of water, 2 and a
     quarter teaspoons of yeast, and your 1-2 teaspoons of sugar. Mix it around
     a bit however is applicable, whether that's a quick pulse of the food
     processor/stand mixer, or just swirling the bowl around.

  3) Wait for the water to start foaming, it should take like 5 minutes. It
     won't be super bubbly, but it'll probably be recognizable.

  4) Prepare an extra 1/3 cup of water, then add the flour and salt (salt after
     because it slows down the yeast activating, whereas sugar acts as food) to
     the bowl, and a splash of olive oil to help avoid sticking to your hands and
     such. You can also cover your hands in olive oil to help here.
  
  5) Mix together however is applicable! Your dough will probably not all stick
     to itself or stay together well, and you'll end up with some dry flour.
     Slowly add water and knead it in. Remember, it's easier to add more water
     to a dough than to remove it!
   
  6) Remove mixer bits or food processor blades, and try to knead in any extra
     wet bits that got stuck in the machinery if applicable (happens a lot with
     the food processor in my experience). Splash on oil until it's a bit of a
     slippery coat around the whole thing preventing it from sticking to the
     bowl, then cover the bowl and let sit for 1 hour, until it's doubled in
     apparent size, or longer if you like. Letting it sit overnight gives really
     good results sometimes! It works in a flavor from the yeast fermenting.

  7) After you've waited, knead it into a ball, applying olive oil to your hands
     to avoid sticking as necessary. You can separate it out, either tearing by
     hand into roughly equal measures, or cutting with a bread knife. You can
     just work the individual pieces into balls, and freeze any you're not going
     to use right now.

  8) Let it sit for another 30 minutes or so!
   
  9) More kneading! What I do is get roughly a ball-like shape, and then keep
     folding the outer edges in and onto the bottom. If you have a flat work
     surface, it kind of works better that way. But basically just, get it so
     you have this round pebble-like shape of dough, where the bottom really is
     kind of a mess, continuously pushing more into the bottom so the top bit
     gets all stretched out. If you have it tear in a way where it struggles to
     stick together, a bit of water will help act as a glue. You can also flour
     your work surface for this! And you'll be roughly done when you can poke it
     and watch the dent bounce back up til it's all smooth and round again.

 10) Stretch it out onto your baking surface (more on that next step), get the
     rough shape you're going for, pick it up by the edge to stretch it out, et
     cetera. Just have fun~! You'll want it relatively thin, though of course
     the overall thickness preference varies. Your dough will rise a fair bit in
     the oven, so make sure to account for that. Super thick dough means VERY
     thick pizza, to where it might not cook all the way through.

 11) Now, there are a few options for surfaces to bake it on. I own a
     perforated pizza pan, which has a bunch of holes poked into it, to get the
     bottom crust as hot as the toppings. A baking stone is made to be put in
     the oven when you start pre-heating, and you can do the same thing by
     flipping a baking sheet pan upside-down. You can use a second baking sheet
     pan to slide it on top, like a pizza peel that they use in brick ovens.
     Also you can literally just put ot on a normal-ass pan without heating the
     pan, and it will be perfectly fine. Perforations and baking stones are just
     kind of that extra touch for a little bit more crispiness.

 12) Preheat~! 500 degrees fahrenheit, or I guess 260 celsius? It has never
     occurred to me that there are ovens with celsius temperature
     knobs/displays. Anyway. Yeah. If you're using a baking stone or cookie
     sheet subsitute, put that in the oven at the same time as you start
     preheating. Baking stones also take a lot longer to heat up, to where
     letting your oven heat for 30+ minutes might be good.

 13) Top that pizza!! (🐰 snrk.) No wrong answers. Put what makes you happy,
     whether that's tomato sauce and tomato slices or a fuckton of cheese, or
     whatever! Just try not to layer things on too thick, or it could impact the
     crust baking properly a little bit. There's a reason that when you order
     pizza from a place, the more toppings you add, the less of each topping you
     get.

 14) Bake for 12-15 minutes! I set a timer for 10, then keep an eye on it from
     then on. If you have cheese on top, the cheese browning can server as a
     marker of being done, but the crust will start to crisp and get brown and
     thin parts of the sauce that may have ended up on the outer crust will
     kinda bake into it.
