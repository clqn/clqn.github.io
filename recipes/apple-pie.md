this recipe comes from my mom, who in turn got it from one of her friends (it was a family recipe of his). i havent had the opportunity to try & make it myself yet, but i've eaten it, and it's very delicious.

## apple filling

- 3 tart apples (ex. granny smith)
- 3 baking apples (ex. honey crisp)
- 1/2 a lemon's worth of juice.
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 heaping tbs flour
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp cloves
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg

peel, core, and slice the apples. aim for ~5mm thick slices. add the flour, lemon juice, sugar, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. blend in large mixing bowl with a spatula or something.

## crust

2 heaping cups of flour
1 stick salted butter (but save 2 tbs for the last part)
2/3 cup butter-flavored shortening
1 tsp salt

use a pastry cutter to cut the butter up into little pieces. do not let the butter get soft/warm. put it back into the fridge to harden after cutting it. then use the pastry cutter to blend the above components until mixed (they should look like little crumbs when done)

add 0.5 cups + 2 tbs ice water. do not take too long with this next part. you want to keep the dough as cold as possible.

knead the dough by hand into a ball. separate into 2 balls. take first ball and roll on floured cloth out to a circle that is larger than the pie plate. gently place into pan. there should be enough dough that it hangs an inch over (roll thinner and try again if it doesnt)

once the lower crust is in, pour the filling into the unbaked crust. take the second ball of dough and roll it into a circle and put it on top of the filling. fold the top crust over the bottom crust and crimp them together. cut a bunch of vents (like 8) on top and add a few pats of butter on top (they'll melt into the vents, ideally) brush on 2-3 tbs of cream, and sprinkle on 0.25 cups of cinnamon sugar. 

bake @ 400°F for 12 minutes, then lower temperature to 375°F for 50 minutes. check at 40 minutes to see if crust needs tenting with foil to avoid overbrowning.
